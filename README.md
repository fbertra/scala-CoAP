VERY LONG TERM GOAL: run a scala-native app using the CoAP protocol on top of an micro kernel like LK Littlekernel or Solo5.

CoAP is an internet protocol targeting the Internet of Things. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252 and http://coap.technology/ 

step #1: create an mini CoAP stack in scala and test it on the JVM.  

step #2: cross compile it with scala-native.

step #3: run it on a "big IoT" device like Rasberry PI

step #4: run a scala-native hello world app above LK or Solo5 and run it on a smaller IoT device

step #5: run the demo SN app and server SB app on LK or Solo5
