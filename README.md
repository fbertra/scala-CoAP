VERY LONG TERM GOAL: run a Scala app based on the CoAP protocol and above an micro kernel like LK Littlekernel or Solo5.

First step: create an mini CoAP stack in Scala and test it on the JVM.  CoAP is an internet protocol targeting the Internet of Things.
See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252 and http://coap.technology/ 

Second step: cross compile it with Scala-native.

Third step: run hello world app above LK or Solo5
